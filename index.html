			<p class="rowMaster">Hi there, I'm Jack.  Welcome to my website! I'm so glad you're here.  
			You've come to the right place if you're any type of aviation buff, like me.  
			But, even if you're not, you could still check out the "Aviation Enthusiasts 
			of Cincinnati" page for some cool events related to aviation in the Cincinnati 
			Area (see links at top of page). Maybe it will spark your interest! I've also 
			included a link for gamers on all things Flight Sim! If you wish to know more 
			about me, head to the "About Me" page...I figure I would have shared enough 
			already on this page already.
			<br><br><strong>Thank you for visiting my site!</strong></p>
