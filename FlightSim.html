			<h2>What is a Flight Simulator?</h2>
			<p class="simPar">Logically, a flight simulator is a system that is used to replicate the 
			experience of being an airplane pilot.  There are two main types of 
			flight simulators: professional pilot training simulators and the personal flight sim, that 
			comes as a computer program to be used on a personal computer.  Professional pilot training 
			simulators are used to train pilots on a specific aircraft type. Along with being a flight simulator program,
			they feature a hyper-relistic cockpit with controls identical to the aircraft being trained on
			and often sit on hydraulic jacks which can provide g-force and simulate turbulence similar to 
			realistic flight.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>List of Some of the Most Popular Flight Sims:<h2>
			<h3>Microsoft Flight Simulator</h3>
			<p class="simPar">Released: 2020. A very well rounded simulator with hyper-realistic graphics.
			Great for beginners and pros alike.</p>
			<h3>X-Plane</h3>
			<p class="simPar">Multiple Releases: 2022 most recent. The leader when it comes to flight dynamics/physics. 
			A popular choice for professional pilots.</p>
			<h3>Aerofly FS</h3>
			<p class="simPar">Released: 2024. One of the only "decent" sims that is actually quite computer-friendly.</p>
			<h3>Infinite Flight</h3>
			<p class="simPar">Released: 2011. A must-have for those that want to fly on a mobile device.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>My personal take:</h2>
			<p class="simPar">Personally, I'm a devoted Microsoft Flight Simultor fan. I'm acctually referring here to 
			a series of flight sims released by Microsoft, not just the 2020 game by the same name.  My all-time favorite 
			is Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), which was released all the way back in 2006.  Why, Jack, do you still play
			a game from 2006? I'll tell you. Part of the reason is it's overall simplicity as a game and the other is that I never 
			felt like moving on. I do have and enjoy playing the Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) from time-to-time and will likely 
			download its 2024 successor soon.</p>
