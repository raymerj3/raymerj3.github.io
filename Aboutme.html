			<p class="rowMaster">I've been an aviation buff ever since I was child.  
			When I was just a few years old, my dad, a private pilot, would take me up
			in his airplane and show me all the bells and whistles, to my amazement.  Unfortuenely,
			my dad passed away in his aircraft in 2001, when I was just 5, but his passion 
			for everything aviation lives strong within me to this day!  I have taken a few flight lessons
			over the years; my uncle is also a pilot and took me up and let me fly his plane on multiple 
			occasions.  I have considered getting a private pilot's license, like my dad, but I never found 
			the right time to go through the extensive training, not to mention the cost!  My favorite plane of 
			all time, though I have many, would have to be the Concorde, a monumental aircraft for its time.
			Boy, do I wish the Concorde was still flying today!  In my free-time you can find me playing FSX,
			a common flight sim (see "Flight Simulator" page) and also coding in one of my favorite 
			programming languages.</p>
